Ghost kitchens are small kitchens that are only avalable to order online through 3rd party logistics such as uber, doordash, and grubhub. These ghost kitchens leverage low start up costs and reduce risk by running multiple brands to achieve profability in their business model. \n\n\nBeing able to provide an idea of not only the medium house income of a targeted area but also know if the people in these areas are searching for food would be very valuable information for ghost kitchen investors. The areas with higher food searches and high medium home income wouuld help them have higher potential for success.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "1.We are going to use <a href = 'https://www.zipcodestogo.com/Texas/'>ZipCodestogo </a>  to get Texas Zip Codes, City, and County."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "2.<a href= \"http://localistica.com/usa/tx/austin/zipcodes/most-populated-zipcodes/'\">Locallistica </a> Population Data for Texas"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "3.<a href = 'https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/download/?format=csv&refine.state=TX&timezone=America/Chicago&lang=en&use_labels_for_header=true&csv_separator=%3B'>opendatasoft </a> Median Home Income Texas"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "4.Latitude and longitud location data for citis in Nw Hampshire Gathered by using the geopy which is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services, and th service we will be using is Nominatim.

The data we found usefull were  Zip Code, Latitude, Longitude, Population, Growth, Age, Income per household.\n\nAfter converting the information into one table we filtered the table to only show results for Austin, TX. I used Folium to generate a map of Austin texas and show the zipcodes to their relative area.\n\nFourscuare API was used to search most common venues in each zip code within Austin, TX. We used this top venues in each zip code data to see if food is in the top 5 searches. \n\nafter eliminate zipcode with a median house income below $50,000 we have a more precise area of where we should be looking.\n\nI used k-means clustering method to the data set to cluster the neighborhoods and venues searches to those neighborhoods"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Results\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": " We can see that any of that any of thes options on the map would be an ideal place to open a cloud kitchen.
